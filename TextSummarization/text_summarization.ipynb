       "\"We got independence long back, but drinking water is still availed there through camels, almost 800 camels were deputed for this task of water supply. When I went there and saw the problem of drinking water, we arranged water from the east of Gujarat and laid 700 km long pipelines and fresh water of Narmada is now supplied to the last point of Indian border..! Friends, this is not done because we have budget, or we have the technology to lay the pipes but it's done because of the sense of respect and honour that we have for the soldiers deputed on the border, this respect makes us do this and make their needs a priority to us..! The battle of 1965 took place in our land and we did not have any memorial for the martyrs..! I will proudly give this information to all the officers that we built a memorial of heroic martyrs in their honour at the Pakistan border, dedicated it to the nation and have also mentioned it on our tourist map. And I request the youngsters of the nation that whenever you get a chance to visit that area, please visit that war memorial and bow down to it, it will fill you with consciousness and culture..!\\nPakistan is not putting an end to its activities, China keeps threatening us often, it intrudes our land..! Not only this, it is trying to bar down the waters of Brahmaputra, to capture Arunachal Pradesh from us..! Is it happening because of the weakness of our army friends..? Are the neighboring countries troubling us because the army is not capable..? Friends, problem is not on the border, the problem is in Delhi, and thus we will have to find its solution also in Delhi only..! Till the time we do not have an efficient, patriot and a government dedicated to safety of every Indian citizen in Delhi, it does not matter how capable our defence forces are, how modern warfare equipments we have, we will not be able to guarantee the security..! Friends, the number of soldiers that India has lost in terrorist attacks, of Maoist attacks and of disruptive powers, it is much higher than the number of soldiers that we have lost in the battleground after independence..!\\nUnited Nations was formed to protect the world from wars. The U.N.O. is trying to fulfill it responsibility so that the third world war does not happen. They must be feeling that it's been so many years, but the condition of third world war has not arisen..! But today I want to say this publically that UNO should not feel proud because now the form, the face and the method of war has changed, and because of it the more countries and more people are suffering in the world than what were suffering at the time of first and second world war, by means of proxy war, and the name of this war is terrorism, Maoism..! And thus it is need of the hour that the entire world should have a public opinion against terrorism, against Maoism, against violence. If India has a capable leadership than having the world's support against terrorism, Maoism and violence will not be very tough.\\nPakistan has recently got a democratically elected government. There was a hope that after it coming to power that they will come ahead as a friendly state setting aside the politics of attacking India. But the manner in which our soldiers were murdered at the border, it states that their intentions are not good. I want to clearly state to the governance of Pakistan that whether it is India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, if we have to fight, then we should fight against poverty, we should fight against illiteracy, we should fight against superstitions..! I want to say this to my friends in Pakistan that this character of conceiving weapons and artilleries has done no good to you in last 60 years. The regime of Pakistan needs to understand that if for 10 years, you do not let terrorists flourish on your land, do not protect them and do not let your land become a breeding ground for them, and you will see that Pakistan will progress much more than its progress all together in last 60 years, the Pakistani youth will be benefitted, Pakistan will come out of poverty. Not only this because of this war mongering mindset of Pakistan, because of their terrorist activities, they have change India also into a war field. Earlier wars used to happen at the borders, between the soldiers, they used to fight, they used to win or lose, but now when you could not defeat the Indian army then you have started this game of killing innocents..! By killing the innocents, through these terrorists who have come from Pakistan, cross border terrorism can not do good for India, for Pakistan or for Bangladesh. And thus Friends I want to tell this to Pakistan in clear terms that even if you were formed because of Anti-India politics, but your life can not be based on Anti-India politics, you can not develop through Anti-India politics..! For your good, for welfare of your youth, take back on the wrong way that you have walked on for 60 years, and let us all together fight against poverty, illiteracy, superstitions and give message of peace to the world from the land of Mahatma Gandhi..!\\nthe game of vote bank politics has become so ugly in our nation, every corner has become a prey of vote bank politics, if the country is capable, neither China can raise its brow on us, nor Pakistan can trouble us the way they do and thus, we need to realize the dream of a strong government, of a strong leadership, of a strong army and a strong nation..!Friends, today because of the neglect of the military in the country, due to habit to degrade the glory of military, due to ignorance of the opportunities of honouring the military, the youth does not show interest to join army. This is a great challenge for any nation. At the top level in the army, 40% posts of officers are vacant today. Friends it is essential that the educated and intelligent youth of the nation joins our defence forces. Now more than fighting from the borders, the wars will be fought through technology, there will be cyber wars, and there we would need dynamic, energetic and intelligent youth. We need to modernize the army, we have to connect the vibrant youth if the nation to the defence forces and in that direction the Delhi government will have to create an atmosphere of trust. It needs to create an environment that joining army should be a matter of pride and then this will happen..!\\nmany such areas in our nation, where we can utilize the potential of our ex-army men and could have used their discipline and work culture for the benefit of the nation. Now let us see, the fire brigade, every town of India has a fire brigade. Have we ever thought that if we recruit our retired servicemen in the fire brigade, incidence of fire would never take place in this country..! We are not ready to think..! Friends our country is not being able to make a place in the olympics. One of our friends has made us proud in the Olympics, won medal in the Olympics, an army man, Rajyavardhan Rathore, he is amongst us..! The army men live in cantonment. If the country decides to give special sports training to harness the skills of these army men, then wouldn’t we be able to excel in Olympics..?We would be friends, but there should be someone to think like that..! Either they have no time to think or God has given them a vacuum and thus they are not capable of any new thought. Friends when I came to Gujarat, there used to be huge power theft in the state. What we did was, we constituted a team of ex-servicemen. We recruited almost 1000 ex-servicemen, provided them with a uniform and gave them the responsibility to prevent the theft. Friends, we did not even face a need of any legal proceeding. Just looking at the army uniform, there was a such a moral impact that the thieves thought that an army man has come and I am stealing. The thefts came to an end Friends. Our electricity field got strengthened because of 1000 army men. Friends, what I mean to say is that even today there's a respect towards this uniform in our nation, and we use it in the right manner, then we will get required results, and we should strive in that direction only Friends.\\nThe budget of the forces is in lakhs of crores of rupees, which is mainly spent on importing armaments. It's a country of 125 crore people, we have scientists with the caliber to launch Agni missiles, but even if we need the smallest components, we have to get it from foreign. Whose interest is it..? And the rulers sitting in Delhi are more interested in knowing the release of next tender, than knowing about the condition of the forces, because tenders are business of millions,why will they even be concerned about these small issues..! Friends, and for this, we should be self dependent in the armaments that our nation needs for the wars. Not only this, we are a country of 125 people, with so many young minds, engineers and technology we should dream that in the coming era, the nations of the world will buy warfare from us. We should dream of exporting warfare..! This capability is not difficult. Friends, mine is a small state, but we have started courses of developing defence equipments in colleges for our engineering students. We have right now started working on development of human resource. We should motivate Indian companies, and by motivating them we should develop what Indian army needs here in India, for that we spend accordingly then I am sure Friends, there will be rise of a new power in India..! And we should give priority to defence offset, we should emphasize on production in our nation, we should build strategies, we should give level field to the imported and manufactured in India goods..! We show our might in research, but what is the condition, Friends..? When we take warfare from a foreign nation, then whenever there is a war, and if the policies of that nation from which we avail these arms from are against us, then even after paying in billions and trillions, they stop supplying at the time of the need. India has faced this problem in the past. The supply of warfare stopped at the time of need, though we have paid but the foreign policy of that nation is not in favour, thus it's stopped. Friends, if we keep buying from foreign, and if tomorrow we enter in a major war, and the nations who are supplying us stop doing so, then what will happen to us, have you ever thought of it..? And thus we should have our own strength, our own capability and for this we should utilize the youth power of this nation..!\\nthere are many of us who could not enter the armed services to serve the safety of this nation, but Friends, there is one more opportunity that we get in our life to serve the nation and that opportunity is the right to vote..! Today I want to say to the youth of the nation. When a kid goes to school for the first time, then there is an environment of joy and happiness in the house, when it is the first birthday of the kid, then there is an atmosphere of joy in the house, when someone's son or daughter get married, there's a celebration, but the constitution of India gives us a great gift, and when we get it we do not even know the power of it..! Friends, when at the age of 18 we get a right to vote, it is the biggest gift given to us by the constitution of India and we should be proud of it..!There should be an atmosphere that when someone gets 18 years of age, we should congratulatethem..! And I want to say to the youth of the nation that you want to make India a capable nation, don't you..? You want the nation to be strong? You want a strong government in Delhi..? Then check whether you have the right to vote or not..? Whether your name is there in voter's list or not, no one in your friends, relatives, neighbors who is of 18 years should be left. Will you do this..? Will you make people voters..? This is a holy task, every party should do it, every citizen should do it..! And I request the former servicemen that for solution of your problems, connect to the youth of the nation, start the campaign to make them voters, and you will see that we will evolve with a new strength..!\\nBharat Mata ki Jai..! Not one but both, say with all your strength, Vande Mataram..! Vande Mataram..!\\n\""

       "\"\\nWrite a summary of the following speech:\\nSpeech:We got independence long back, but drinking water is still availed there through camels, almost 800 camels were deputed for this task of water supply. When I went there and saw the problem of drinking water, we arranged water from the east of Gujarat and laid 700 km long pipelines and fresh water of Narmada is now supplied to the last point of Indian border..! Friends, this is not done because we have budget, or we have the technology to lay the pipes but it's done because of the sense of respect and honour that we have for the soldiers deputed on the border, this respect makes us do this and make their needs a priority to us..! The battle of 1965 took place in our land and we did not have any memorial for the martyrs..! I will proudly give this information to all the officers that we built a memorial of heroic martyrs in their honour at the Pakistan border, dedicated it to the nation and have also mentioned it on our tourist map. And I request the youngsters of the nation that whenever you get a chance to visit that area, please visit that war memorial and bow down to it, it will fill you with consciousness and culture..!\\nPakistan is not putting an end to its activities, China keeps threatening us often, it intrudes our land..! Not only this, it is trying to bar down the waters of Brahmaputra, to capture Arunachal Pradesh from us..! Is it happening because of the weakness of our army friends..? Are the neighboring countries troubling us because the army is not capable..? Friends, problem is not on the border, the problem is in Delhi, and thus we will have to find its solution also in Delhi only..! Till the time we do not have an efficient, patriot and a government dedicated to safety of every Indian citizen in Delhi, it does not matter how capable our defence forces are, how modern warfare equipments we have, we will not be able to guarantee the security..! Friends, the number of soldiers that India has lost in terrorist attacks, of Maoist attacks and of disruptive powers, it is much higher than the number of soldiers that we have lost in the battleground after independence..!\\nUnited Nations was formed to protect the world from wars. The U.N.O. is trying to fulfill it responsibility so that the third world war does not happen. They must be feeling that it's been so many years, but the condition of third world war has not arisen..! But today I want to say this publically that UNO should not feel proud because now the form, the face and the method of war has changed, and because of it the more countries and more people are suffering in the world than what were suffering at the time of first and second world war, by means of proxy war, and the name of this war is terrorism, Maoism..! And thus it is need of the hour that the entire world should have a public opinion against terrorism, against Maoism, against violence. If India has a capable leadership than having the world's support against terrorism, Maoism and violence will not be very tough.\\nPakistan has recently got a democratically elected government. There was a hope that after it coming to power that they will come ahead as a friendly state setting aside the politics of attacking India. But the manner in which our soldiers were murdered at the border, it states that their intentions are not good. I want to clearly state to the governance of Pakistan that whether it is India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, if we have to fight, then we should fight against poverty, we should fight against illiteracy, we should fight against superstitions..! I want to say this to my friends in Pakistan that this character of conceiving weapons and artilleries has done no good to you in last 60 years. The regime of Pakistan needs to understand that if for 10 years, you do not let terrorists flourish on your land, do not protect them and do not let your land become a breeding ground for them, and you will see that Pakistan will progress much more than its progress all together in last 60 years, the Pakistani youth will be benefitted, Pakistan will come out of poverty. Not only this because of this war mongering mindset of Pakistan, because of their terrorist activities, they have change India also into a war field. Earlier wars used to happen at the borders, between the soldiers, they used to fight, they used to win or lose, but now when you could not defeat the Indian army then you have started this game of killing innocents..! By killing the innocents, through these terrorists who have come from Pakistan, cross border terrorism can not do good for India, for Pakistan or for Bangladesh. And thus Friends I want to tell this to Pakistan in clear terms that even if you were formed because of Anti-India politics, but your life can not be based on Anti-India politics, you can not develop through Anti-India politics..! For your good, for welfare of your youth, take back on the wrong way that you have walked on for 60 years, and let us all together fight against poverty, illiteracy, superstitions and give message of peace to the world from the land of Mahatma Gandhi..!\\nthe game of vote bank politics has become so ugly in our nation, every corner has become a prey of vote bank politics, if the country is capable, neither China can raise its brow on us, nor Pakistan can trouble us the way they do and thus, we need to realize the dream of a strong government, of a strong leadership, of a strong army and a strong nation..!Friends, today because of the neglect of the military in the country, due to habit to degrade the glory of military, due to ignorance of the opportunities of honouring the military, the youth does not show interest to join army. This is a great challenge for any nation. At the top level in the army, 40% posts of officers are vacant today. Friends it is essential that the educated and intelligent youth of the nation joins our defence forces. Now more than fighting from the borders, the wars will be fought through technology, there will be cyber wars, and there we would need dynamic, energetic and intelligent youth. We need to modernize the army, we have to connect the vibrant youth if the nation to the defence forces and in that direction the Delhi government will have to create an atmosphere of trust. It needs to create an environment that joining army should be a matter of pride and then this will happen..!\\nmany such areas in our nation, where we can utilize the potential of our ex-army men and could have used their discipline and work culture for the benefit of the nation. Now let us see, the fire brigade, every town of India has a fire brigade. Have we ever thought that if we recruit our retired servicemen in the fire brigade, incidence of fire would never take place in this country..! We are not ready to think..! Friends our country is not being able to make a place in the olympics. One of our friends has made us proud in the Olympics, won medal in the Olympics, an army man, Rajyavardhan Rathore, he is amongst us..! The army men live in cantonment. If the country decides to give special sports training to harness the skills of these army men, then wouldn’t we be able to excel in Olympics..?We would be friends, but there should be someone to think like that..! Either they have no time to think or God has given them a vacuum and thus they are not capable of any new thought. Friends when I came to Gujarat, there used to be huge power theft in the state. What we did was, we constituted a team of ex-servicemen. We recruited almost 1000 ex-servicemen, provided them with a uniform and gave them the responsibility to prevent the theft. Friends, we did not even face a need of any legal proceeding. Just looking at the army uniform, there was a such a moral impact that the thieves thought that an army man has come and I am stealing. The thefts came to an end Friends. Our electricity field got strengthened because of 1000 army men. Friends, what I mean to say is that even today there's a respect towards this uniform in our nation, and we use it in the right manner, then we will get required results, and we should strive in that direction only Friends.\\nThe budget of the forces is in lakhs of crores of rupees, which is mainly spent on importing armaments. It's a country of 125 crore people, we have scientists with the caliber to launch Agni missiles, but even if we need the smallest components, we have to get it from foreign. Whose interest is it..? And the rulers sitting in Delhi are more interested in knowing the release of next tender, than knowing about the condition of the forces, because tenders are business of millions,why will they even be concerned about these small issues..! Friends, and for this, we should be self dependent in the armaments that our nation needs for the wars. Not only this, we are a country of 125 people, with so many young minds, engineers and technology we should dream that in the coming era, the nations of the world will buy warfare from us. We should dream of exporting warfare..! This capability is not difficult. Friends, mine is a small state, but we have started courses of developing defence equipments in colleges for our engineering students. We have right now started working on development of human resource. We should motivate Indian companies, and by motivating them we should develop what Indian army needs here in India, for that we spend accordingly then I am sure Friends, there will be rise of a new power in India..! And we should give priority to defence offset, we should emphasize on production in our nation, we should build strategies, we should give level field to the imported and manufactured in India goods..! We show our might in research, but what is the condition, Friends..? When we take warfare from a foreign nation, then whenever there is a war, and if the policies of that nation from which we avail these arms from are against us, then even after paying in billions and trillions, they stop supplying at the time of the need. India has faced this problem in the past. The supply of warfare stopped at the time of need, though we have paid but the foreign policy of that nation is not in favour, thus it's stopped. Friends, if we keep buying from foreign, and if tomorrow we enter in a major war, and the nations who are supplying us stop doing so, then what will happen to us, have you ever thought of it..? And thus we should have our own strength, our own capability and for this we should utilize the youth power of this nation..!\\nthere are many of us who could not enter the armed services to serve the safety of this nation, but Friends, there is one more opportunity that we get in our life to serve the nation and that opportunity is the right to vote..! Today I want to say to the youth of the nation. When a kid goes to school for the first time, then there is an environment of joy and happiness in the house, when it is the first birthday of the kid, then there is an atmosphere of joy in the house, when someone's son or daughter get married, there's a celebration, but the constitution of India gives us a great gift, and when we get it we do not even know the power of it..! Friends, when at the age of 18 we get a right to vote, it is the biggest gift given to us by the constitution of India and we should be proud of it..!There should be an atmosphere that when someone gets 18 years of age, we should congratulatethem..! And I want to say to the youth of the nation that you want to make India a capable nation, don't you..? You want the nation to be strong? You want a strong government in Delhi..? Then check whether you have the right to vote or not..? Whether your name is there in voter's list or not, no one in your friends, relatives, neighbors who is of 18 years should be left. Will you do this..? Will you make people voters..? This is a holy task, every party should do it, every citizen should do it..! And I request the former servicemen that for solution of your problems, connect to the youth of the nation, start the campaign to make them voters, and you will see that we will evolve with a new strength..!\\nBharat Mata ki Jai..! Not one but both, say with all your strength, Vande Mataram..! Vande Mataram..!\\n\\nTranslate the precise summary to: Hindi\\n\""

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

      "\n",
      "In his farewell speech, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the people of India and those abroad for the wonderful association during his five-year tenure in Rashtrapati Bhavan. He highlighted 10 key messages that he learned during his interactions with the public:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development based on the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Focus on agricultural growth from seed to food.\n",
      "5. Overcome problems and succeed.\n",
      "6. Address problems through partnership.\n",
      "7. Show courage in combating calamities.\n",
      "8. Foster connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "9. Defend the nation with pride.\n",
      "10. Encourage a youth movement for a Developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam shared a personal anecdote about a question from a little girl named Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. Kalam assured her that it was a thoughtful question and that he believed India could achieve this goal with the right mindset and effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, acknowledged it as thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, where they would work on making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and utilizing the potential of the youth to achieve a developed India by 2020. The President highlights a visit to a village in Nagaland where he saw an empowered village council functioning effectively and making decisions. However, he notes that physical connectivity is still lacking, hindering the movement of products from villages to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also discusses the initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which implemented the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex in 65 villages. This initiative provided three connectivities: physical, electronic, and knowledge, leading to economic connectivity. The PURA complex included healthcare centers, educational institutions, and vocational training centers, resulting in large-scale employment generation and the creation of numerous entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech aims to mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness and to empower villages to deal with their own development, while also fostering connectivity between rural and urban areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a successful initiative called Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) in Thanjavur district. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 1000 self-help groups have been actively supported to generate employment and create entrepreneurs.\n",
      "2. 200 acres of waste land have been developed into cultivable land, enabling villagers to engage in activities such as:\n",
      "   - Planting Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants\n",
      "   - Bio-mass power generation\n",
      "   - Food processing\n",
      "   - Running marketing centers\n",
      "3. The PURA model provides a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "4. A co-operative venture between villagers, experts from Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, and JETRO specialists has led to the development of 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products.\n",
      "5. This initiative has enhanced the innovative ability of the people in 65 villages, enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "6. The speaker believes that the country needs 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a motivational and inspirational message from a high-ranking official in India, possibly the President. Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker shares an enriching experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists.\n",
      "2. The speaker highlights the importance of agriculture, stating that it's the backbone of the nation and that India needs to double its agricultural production with reduced resources.\n",
      "3. The speaker emphasizes the need to empower farmers to protect and nurture the land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "4. Meeting with scientists and farmers has given the speaker confidence that India can increase its agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "5. The speech then shifts to a personal anecdote about a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who has no hands or legs but is a happy and confident person. \n",
      "6. Krishna Murthy thanks his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence and training. \n",
      "7. When asked what the speaker could do for him, Krishna Murthy replies that he just wants to sing in front of the speaker, which shows his strength and resilience in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech is a message of hope and empowerment for farmers, scientists, and the nation, and highlights the importance of confidence, resilience, and determination in overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a motivational and uplifting message. The speaker shares a heartwarming encounter with a person who, despite being physically challenged, possesses a remarkable talent for music. This person's positive attitude, perseverance, and the support of his parents, teachers, and others have allowed him to blossom as a musician.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of overcoming adversity through partnership and team effort. The speaker shares an example from their visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite facing significant losses, the people of Urusa showed remarkable courage and resilience in the face of adversity. They actively partnered with the Army, Air Force, and state government to overcome their problems, rather than letting them become their master.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is one of hope, inspiration, and the power of human spirit in the face of challenges and adversity. It encourages the audience to adopt a positive attitude and work together to overcome problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from a public figure, likely the President of India, Pratibha Patil or her successor, Pranab Mukherjee or possibly Dr. Manmohan Singh. However, given the context, I believe it is more likely by Pratibha Patil (the first female President of India) based on the 'Sea Waves' poem. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes a relief operation in a village affected by an earthquake, where the children and villagers participated bravely and were smiling despite the challenges. They witnessed an on-the-spot settlement of relief grants by the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and State Government authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares a personal experience of visiting Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where she met Tribal Council Leaders and children. Despite many human losses, the tribal islanders showed immense courage by adopting the affected victims as their own, without an orphanage on the island. Inspired by their bravery, she composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\", which they sang together, showcasing their enthusiasm and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, on September 16, 2004, but the speech does not provide further details about this event.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from the Indian Prime Minister, although the speaker is not explicitly mentioned. \n",
      "\n",
      "The key points from the speech are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker proposed the \"Pan African e-Network\" project, which would connect 53 African countries with an estimated cost of $100 million.\n",
      "2. The project aims to provide seamless and integrated networks through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology.\n",
      "3. The project includes connecting 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa), 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa.\n",
      "4. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.\n",
      "5. The Indira Gandhi National Open University has taken up an MBA course for 34 Ethiopian students from Addis Ababa and Harmaya Universities.\n",

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.
